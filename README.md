## Responsiveness

The whole website is responsive to different screen sizes made using CSS media queries and Material UI.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/er-rahulkr95/Blog-App
```

Go to the project directories in different terminals

For Frontend 

```bash
  cd frontend
```

For Backend 

```bash
  cd backend
```

Install dependencies in both the directories separately

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server in both the directories separately

```bash
  npm run start
```

It will runs the app in the development mode.
Backend will start on http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

It will runs the app in the development mode.
Frontend will start on http://localhost:3001 , go the url to view it in your browser. 
**Here Port number number can change depending upon your device free ports or ports not in use.** 

# Other available scripts

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

```bash
  npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Eject

```bash
  npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
